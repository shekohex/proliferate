Welcome! Here's how to go from zero to coding in the cloud.

## The basic flow

1. **Connect your repo** - Link a GitHub repository you want to work on
2. **Set up your environment** - Run a setup session to install dependencies and configure services
3. **Save a snapshot** - Capture your configured environment so you can reuse it
4. **Start coding** - Launch coding sessions from your snapshot and build with AI

## Your first time

### 1. Add a repository

Click **Add Repo** and connect your GitHub account. Pick a repository - we'll clone it to your cloud environment.

### 2. Run setup

Click **Set Up** on your repo. An AI agent helps you install dependencies, configure databases, and get everything running. This usually takes a few minutes.

### 3. Save a snapshot

When setup is complete, save a snapshot. Give it a name like "Initial setup" - you'll use this to start coding sessions.

### 4. Start coding

Click **New Session**, pick your snapshot, and start building. The AI agent can write code, debug issues, run tests, and more.

	snapshots: `# Snapshots

Snapshots are saved copies of your cloud development environment. Think of them like checkpoints in a video game - you can always come back to where you left off.

## What gets saved?

When you create a snapshot, we capture:

- **All your code changes** - edited files, new files, deleted files
- **Installed dependencies** - npm packages, Python libraries, etc.
- **Database state** - PostgreSQL data, Redis cache
- **Configuration** - environment variables, tool settings
- **Running services** - the exact state of your dev servers

## Why use snapshots?

### Start faster
Instead of waiting for dependencies to install every time, start from a snapshot with everything already set up. New sessions launch in seconds instead of minutes.

### Experiment safely
Try risky changes without fear. If something breaks, just start a new session from your last working snapshot.

### Share setups
Create a snapshot with your preferred tools and configs. Your whole team can use it as a starting point.

## Creating snapshots

During a **setup session**, you can save a snapshot at any time by clicking the camera icon. Give it a name like "Base setup" or "With auth configured" so you can find it later.

## Using snapshots

When you start a new **coding session**, you'll choose which snapshot to use. Pick the one that's closest to what you need - you can always make changes and save a new snapshot.

## Can I skip snapshots?

Yes! If you prefer, you can start coding sessions without a snapshot. Your environment will be set up fresh each time, which takes longer but gives you a clean slate.`,

	"setup-sessions": `# Setup Sessions

A setup session is a one-time initialization phase where an AI agent configures your cloud environment. Once saved as a snapshot, every future coding session boots instantly from that exact state.

## What is happening?

You're watching the agent work in real-time. It autonomously:

1. **Installs dependencies** — npm, pip, cargo, whatever your project needs
2. **Configures services** — databases, caches, queues, all running locally
3. **Verifies everything works** — hits endpoints, runs tests, takes screenshots

## Your role

- **Watch the agent work** — it handles most setup autonomously
- **Provide secrets when prompted** — if the project needs third-party API keys (Stripe, etc.), the agent will show a secure form in the chat
- **Click "Done — Save Snapshot"** when the agent confirms everything is working

## What does "Done — Save Snapshot" do?

It freezes the entire environment — code, dependencies, databases, running services — into a reusable image. All future coding sessions for this repo will boot from this saved state in seconds, skipping the entire setup process.

## Configured vs. not configured

- **Configured** — a setup session has run, a snapshot is saved. Coding sessions boot instantly.
- **Not configured** — no setup yet. You can still start a coding session, but the agent will need to install everything from scratch.

## Local IDE Access

Use the built-in VS Code panel or terminal in this session to edit and run code directly in the sandbox environment.

## Tips

- **Be specific** — "Install Node 20" is better than "install node"
- **Check the logs** — if something fails, the error messages help the agent fix it
- **Iterate** — you can always re-run setup and save a new snapshot`,

	"coding-sessions": `# Coding Sessions

Coding sessions are where the real work happens. You have a fully configured cloud environment and an AI agent ready to help you build.

## Starting a session

Pick a snapshot to start from, and you'll have a ready-to-go environment in seconds. All your dependencies are installed, services are running, and you can start coding immediately.

## What you can do

### Write code together
Describe what you want to build, and the agent writes the code. You can be as high-level ("add user authentication") or specific ("add a logout button to the header") as you like.

### Debug issues
Paste an error message or describe unexpected behavior. The agent investigates, finds the problem, and fixes it.

### Explore the codebase
Ask questions about how things work. The agent reads your code and explains it.

### Run commands
Tests, builds, migrations - the agent can run any command and handle the results.

## The preview panel

When you're building something with a UI, the preview panel shows your changes live. Click the preview icon in the header to toggle it.

## Pausing and resuming

Sessions automatically pause when you're away to save resources. When you come back, just click Resume - your environment is restored exactly as you left it.

## Tips

- **Be direct** - "Fix the login bug" works better than "I think there might be an issue with logging in maybe"
- **Give context** - "The signup form should validate email format" is clearer than "add validation"
- **Iterate** - start simple, see the result, then refine`,
